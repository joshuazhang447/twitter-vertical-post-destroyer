# Twitter Vertical Post Destroyer

A Chrome extension designed to merge split vertical image posts on Twitter (X). It combines the separate images into a single, seamless file for both viewing and downloading.

## Description

There has been a recent trend of long vertical images as several separate, stacked images with vertical bars in between, it's super annoying to view them, so I made this extension to solve  that issue by stitching the split images back together, allowing you to save the original full image.
